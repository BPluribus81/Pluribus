                    To protect funders and their donations and investments, we will never be a crowdfunding site that will host practically everything and anything. Any organization seeking funds on Pluribus will be required to provide substantive information on their leadership, history and what the funds will be used for. Any fundraising campaign not able to provide this information will never be hosted here.
